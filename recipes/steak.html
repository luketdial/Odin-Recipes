        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choice cut of steak</li>
                <li>Fresh Garlic <em>(however much you prefer)</em></li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                <li>Rosemary</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>How to Cook</strong></p>
            <p>Before we begin were going to need to go ahead and let our steaks sit out of the fridge for around 15 mins in order to bring them up to room temperature. This allows us to get a perfect sear and still get a nice medium rare.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Once our steaks are at room temp, turn the oven on med/high heat and let pan warm up. Add a dash of Olive Oil.</li>
                <li>While the pan is warming up season steaks generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Once you see smoke coming from the pan put steaks in the pan (away from you), and sear on both sides for about 30 seconds each. This includes the fatty side to help render the fat, making it delicious.</li>
                <li>Now add your full, crushed gloves of garlic, around 2 tbsp of butter, rosemary, and olive oil to pan.</li>
                <li>Start to base the steak whiel it cooks on the other side
                <li>After about 4 turns on each side take your steaks off and you should have a perfect medium rare steak.</li>
                
            </ol>
